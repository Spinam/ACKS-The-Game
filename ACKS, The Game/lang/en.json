Guard training increases a creature's morale score (ML) by 2, to a maximum of +2, but it is highly demanding, equivalent to learning seven tricks from an animal trainer. Many creatures lack the intelligence or temperament to be guards - these are usually trained as hunters instead.

Livestock will not accept riders, pull loads, or carry burdens, and in battle or other stressful situations will tend to react according to their natural instincts (fleeing if a prey animal, or attacking if a predator).

Mounts will not wear barding, and will not charge into melee unless facing natural predators. They will not attack with their natural weapons while carrying a rider. A proficient character (one with Adventuring, Animal Training, Beast Friendship, or Riding proficiency) can safely control a ridden mount outside of battle. If the character has Riding proficiency, he can control a ridden mount in battle; and outside of battle, he can control up to six mounts, one ridden and the others ponied on lead ropes. An unproficient character can safely control a mount on a lead rope, but cannot ride one without grave risk to himself (save versus Paralysis each round or fall off). Mount training counts as five tricks, so when dealing with less-intelligent beasts, suitable specimens might be rare and expensive. Note that even sapient creatures which are to carry riders must be trained as mounts, because the subtleties of communication between rider and mount, and of movement while laden with a rider, do not come naturally."

War mounts will wear barding, and will charge into melee, even if not naturally willing to do so. In melee, war mounts will attack their masters' targets using their natural weapons. War mounts are subject to the same limits on control as mounts (see above). As with guard training, war mount training increases a creature's morale score by 2, to a maximum of +2, and war mounts without riders can function as guard creatures. Training as a war mount is even more demanding than guard or mount training, counting as eight tricks. Very few animals have the intelligence and temperament to serve as war mounts, so they tend to be very expensive. Sapient creatures which are to carry troops into battle must receive war mount training. Unlike creatures of animal intelligence, their morale score is not increased by war mount training, however."
